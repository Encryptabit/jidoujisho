# 📖 Using the application

### 🚨 Supported Formats

jidoujisho will take **video and audio formats as supported by VLC**. Subtitles may be embedded within the video being played and selected during playback. 

If you wish to use external subtitles, they may be in **SRT, ASS or SSA format** and you may import them during playback through the menu. You may switch between different audio and subtitle tracks. Image-based subtitles such as PGS are not currently supported.

**YouTube closed captions** are taken from TimedText XML, which is only publicly exposed to videos that have user-generated Japanese subtitles. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ0sJQC8qkE">Here are a fair sample of</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9zw0QF12Kc">YouTube videos with such subtitles</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1yXDcuwzpY">showcasing some very practical application use cases.</a> If unavailable, **Japanese automatic captions** can be queried from videos. Please be aware that critical inaccuracies are to be expected in such cases.
